The MOLLER experiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims at the measurement of the parity-violating 
asymmetry in the scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons. The high-precision goals necessitate
 estimation of background asymmetry resulting from electrons scattering from various materials into 
 the detector. Since this asymmetry is impossible to calculate with sufficient precision, 
 a computer simulation needed to be developed. Geant4 was chosen as a simulation platform, 
 and its suitability was confirmed by simulating Moller scattering as well as Bremsstrahlung 
 scattering in a thin iron foil and comparing results to the literature on the subject.
 Having gained confidence in the ability of Geant4 to simulate these fundamental processes 
 in isolation, we created a simulation with the targets of thicknesses comparable to or larger 
 than the radiation length of iron. Results from both simulations will be presented and compared
 to the available data.
